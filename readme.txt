Replace the default WooCommerce category image placeholder with a relevant project image instead.

== Description ==

By default, WooCommerce displays a neutral and uninteresting category image placeholder in those cases where a category has 
no explicitly set thumbnail. This plugin simply replaces the placeholder image with a product image from that category.

User can choose whether to use a random product or the latest product from that category.

Feature requests welcome, please [post in the support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-auto-category-thumbnails "Plugin support forum").

**Usage**

There is no complicated setup, simply install the plugin and configure WooCommerce to display categories. Any categories containing products but without a 
category thumbnail will now display a product image.

To switch between random and latest product display, see the settings page under Settings > WC Auto Cat Thumbs. 

More options coming soon. [Plugin release page](http://codebyshellbot.com/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-auto-category-thumbnails/ "WooCommerce Auto Category Thumbnails").

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'woocommerce-auto-cat-thumbnails' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Change settings if required under 'Settings > WC Auto Cat Thumbs' in your WP admin panel
4. Enjoy!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My automatic category images are displaying at weird sizes? =

Make sure your settings are correct under WooCommerce > Settings > Products > Display 
in your WP admin panel. You will need to regenerate your image sizes after changing these 
settings, or possibly on first install of the plugin. [Find the Regenerate Thumbnails plugin here](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/ "Regenerate Thumbnails").
